# Virtual-Painter
The Virtual Painter application allows users to draw on a digital canvas using hand gestures detected via a webcam. It supports changing brush colors and using an eraser with simple hand movements. The application uses MediaPipe for hand tracking and OpenCV for rendering the virtual canvas and interacting with it.
